# Matched Filter Reciever 
--a matched filter implementation in octave

### Uses a truncated Gaussian Pulse to transmit BPSK pulses
### Channel is modelled as a low pass filter . 
### White noise is added to the signal after modulation . 


Decoding is done by a matched filter reciever and bit error rate was calculated for various 
noise power densities 

# dependencies : octave packages - signal and control 

        
        
        sudo apt install octave-signal
